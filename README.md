This repository contains an example Intelligence Request Form (RFI) designed for a detailed analysis of North Korea's importation of defense industry components from global markets. The RFI outlines the client's need (a bank) for an in-depth investigation into the volume and corporate routing of these imports, with a focus on identifying key individuals and entities involved in circumventing international sanctions and embargoes. The analysis aims to uncover the monetary scale of the issue and identify financial service companies potentially involved in laundering these funds. The report will aid in strategic-level decision-making, enhancing internal controls and compliance measures to prevent misuse of the client's institution. The intended audience includes those familiar with money laundering and sanctions evasion but not the specific defense industry supply chain. The report should not exceed 30 pages and include a timeline of significant events.
